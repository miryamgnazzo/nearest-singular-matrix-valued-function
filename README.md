# nearest-singular-matrix-valued-function
This repository contains the code for the numerical approximation of the distance to singularity for matrix-valued functions, as described in

M. Gnazzo, N. Guglielmi. "On the numerical approximation of the distance to singularity for matrix-valued functions", available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01220).

## How to use it:
* **struct_distance**: contains the function for the numerical approximation of the distance to singularity;
* **Script_delay** and **Script_polynomial**: contain two examples and can be used as a reference to run the method.
